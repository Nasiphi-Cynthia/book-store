Cynt Bookstore is a high-end, responsive web application designed for a curated book-buying experience. This project was developed to demonstrate my ability to merge technical logic with a cinematic visual eye. I transitioned the original FreeCodeCamp lab into a multi-file architecture focusing on user experience, pink-accented aesthetics, and functional e-commerce logic.

Key Features

*Interactive Shopping Cart: Users can add items to their "Script Portfolio" in real-time.
*Responsive Set Design: The layout uses a CSS Grid system that adapts flawlessly from desktop monitors to mobile devices.
*Cinematic Animations: Hover effects and transitions designed to mirror modern streaming platform interfaces.
*Checkout Logic: A functional modal system that captures user delivery addresses and manages cart states.

The Tech Stack

*HTML5: Using semantic tags to ensure the "script" of the website is readable by both browsers and screen readers.
*CSS3: Utilizing Custom Variables for consistent branding and Flexbox for layout control.
*JavaScript: Implementing DOM manipulation, event listeners, and array methods to manage the shopping cart data.

File Organization

index.html: Defines the structure and content of the bookstore.

style.css: Contains all the visual styling, animations, and mobile-responsive queries.

script.js: Powers the interactivity, cart math, and modal functionality.

 I successfully implemented:

State Management: Keeping track of the items the user selects.

Data Attributes: Storing product information directly in the HTML for JavaScript to access.

Modular Code: Breaking the project into three distinct files to prepare for professional environment workflows.# book-store
